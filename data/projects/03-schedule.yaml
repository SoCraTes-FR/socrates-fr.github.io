  The conference starts on Thursday at 17:00 and ends on Sunday at 16:00.

  Participants are welcome to arrive at the castle at any time on Thursday, enjoy the venue and the spa, and settle in the salons.
  Room check-in is available from 16:00 (earlier access may be possible if rooms are ready).

  On Sunday, room check-out must be completed by 12:00 at the latest.
  However, participants are welcome to enjoy the venue and the spa, and stay in the salons until the end of the event.

    ## Format

  The event will run as a two-day Open Space.

  In an Open Space, there is no predefined agenda — you create it together.
  This is your time: make the most of it! For ideas on how to prepare, you can take a look at [this article]((http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace)).

  Both facilitation and sessions will be conducted in English to ensure inclusiveness and enable everyone’s participation.

    ## Community-Driven activities

  Morning and evening activities are organized by participants.
  At similar events, evenings have featured everything from music and board games to live-hacking sessions.
  And of course, there’s always the option to simply talk, relax, or carry on the day’s discussions.
