  Ideally located in the heart of Provence, the "[château de Massillan](https://www.chateaudemassillan.fr/en/)" is just a short trip away from major French cities.

  - Only 3h30 by high-speed train from Paris (TGV to Avignon or Orange, then a short taxi ride) or about 6h by car.

  - Just 1h20 from Marseille, 1h45 from Lyon, 1h15 from Montpellier, and 1h from Aix-en-Provence, whether by train or car.

  For participants arriving by train, the organizers will coordinate taxi transfers from Orange or Avignon stations to the Château de Massillan (individual fares to be paid by participants).

  This unique location makes it both easily accessible and the perfect retreat for your stay.
