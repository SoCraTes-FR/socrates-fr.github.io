    ### Inclusiveness

    A primary goal of the SoCraTes conference is to be inclusive of the largest number of contributors, representing the most varied and diverse backgrounds.
    Safe Environment

    We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, programming language, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof).

    We invite all participants of the SoCraTes conference and its wider community to contribute to creating safe and positive experiences for everyone.

    - **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
    - **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or bad manners. We may all experience frustration at times, but it must never turn into personal attacks.
    - **Be mindful of how your words may affect others.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down fellow participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.

    ### Scope
    This Code of Conduct applies to the SoCraTes France conference itself and to all digital spaces related to it, such as the wiki and mailing list.
